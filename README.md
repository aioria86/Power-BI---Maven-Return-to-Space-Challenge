Maven Return to Space Challenge – Power BI Dashboard
This repository contains my full submission for the Maven Return to Space Challenge, where I designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing more than 70 years of global space launches. The report explores rocket performance, mission success, historical spaceflight eras, cost efficiency, and company-level insights.
The goal of this project is to transform raw mission data into a clear, engaging, and interactive analytical story about humanity’s journey to space.

📊 Project Overview

This Power BI report analyzes 4,600+ global space missions and provides insights into:

•	The evolution of launch activity across decades
•	Success vs. failure trends over time
•	Rocket rankings based on a custom Rocket Power Score
•	Company performance (RVSN USSR, Arianespace, CASC, SpaceX, etc.)
•	Success efficiency normalized by billions of dollars spent
•	How spaceflight progressed through the Space Age eras
•	Top-performing rockets and organizations
•	Historical cost trends and mission reliability
The dashboard includes two main pages:
1.	Maven Return to Space Challenge – primary KPIs, rocket rankings, and decade analysis
2.	Additional Insights – time-series performance, eras, and company breakdown

Key Features & Metrics

Rocket Power Score (custom metric)

A composite ranking based on:

•	40% launch volume
•	40% success rate
•	20% cost efficiency

This helps identify rockets with the strongest all-around performance.
Successes per Billion Dollars
Measures efficiency:
Successful launches per USD $1B spent.
Running Total Launches
A cumulative time-series showing long-term mission growth.
Space Age Era Analysis
Breakdown of launches across:
•	Early Space Race
•	Post-Apollo Transition
•	Shuttle Era
•	New Space Era
